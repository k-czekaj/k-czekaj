## Who am I?

<p align="justify">I am <b>software tester</b> who constantly wants to develop.  I always care about <b>high quality</b> and <b>every detail of my tasks</b>. During my training process, I have mastered <b>the skills of exploratory testing, testing of websites and mobile applications, REST API testing, writing test cases, reporting defects</b> and <b>creating test reports.</b> I know how to use <b>SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman, GIT</b> and <b>HTML/CSS</b> basics.The effects can be seen in my <b>PORTFOLIO</b> :point_down:. My curiosity grows with each new skill and knowledge, I am convinced that <b>I want to go deeper into the world of testing.</b> I am ready to take on new challenges as <b>a member of the development team.</b></p>
